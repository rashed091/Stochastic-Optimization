    "The basic idea of a Monte Carlo Algorithm is to use randomness to solve what is often a deterministic problem. In this course, we'll study their application in 3 different places: optimization, integration, and obtaining draws from a probability distribution. These uses are often intertwined: optimization is needed to find modes of distributions and integration to find expectations.\n",

    "Wikipedia has a facinating bit of [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) on the subject, from which I quote:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The first thoughts and attempts I made to practice [the Monte Carlo Method] were suggested by a question which occurred to me in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was what are the chances that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After spending a lot of time trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than \"abstract thinking\" might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later [in 1946], I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.\n",

    ">Being secret, the work of von Neumann and Ulam required a code name.[citation needed] A colleague of von Neumann and Ulam, Nicholas Metropolis, suggested using the name Monte Carlo, which refers to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco where Ulam's uncle would borrow money from relatives to gamble."

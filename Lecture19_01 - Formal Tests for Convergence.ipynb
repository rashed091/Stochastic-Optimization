    "<p>So far, we have looked for stationarity visually. We have inspected traces to see if they are white-noisy. We have made histograms over subsets of the chain, and traceplots of multiple chains with different starting points. Let us now look at some formal tests.</p>\n",

    "<p>Now, assume the usual rejection of $H_0$ if the p-value is below the 5% limit: that is, if $H_0$ is correct, there is only a 5% chance of the absolute value of the mean difference being larger than 2 standard deviations (1.96 to be precise). That is:</p>\n",

    "<p>As we have seen, autocorrelation and stationarity are related but not identical concepts. A large autocorrelation may happen due to strong correlations in parameters (which can be measured), or due to smaller step sizes which are not letting us explore a distribution well. In other words, our mixing is poor. Unidentifiability also typically causes large correlations (and autocorrelations) as two parameters may carry the same information.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The general observation that can be made is that problems in sampling often cause strong autocorrelation, but autocorrelation by itself does not mean that our sampling is wrong. But it is something we should always investigate, and only use our samples if we are convinced that the autocorrelation is benign.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A good measure to have that depends on autocorrelation is effective sample size(ESS). With autocorrelation, the ‘iid’ness of our draws decreases. The ESS quantifies how much. The exact derivation involves us going into time series theory, which we do not have the time to do here. Instead we shall just write the result our:</p>\n",
